# OptionalAssets - Additional PNG Files

The `OptionalAssets` folder contains additional PNG files in lower resolutions. These files are completely optional and are not required for the main functionality of the package. They can be useful if you need lower-resolution versions of the images for your project.

## Contents:
- PNG files in various lower resolutions.
- Packed in multiple ZIP files. Each ZIP file corresponds to a specific resolution.

## How to Use the Additional Files:
1. Unzip the desired file from the `OptionalAssets` folder on your computer.
2. Copy the necessary files into your Unity project, placing them in the `Assets/CorePro/2D/` folder (or any other folder you prefer).
3. The files will be available in Unity as standard textures or sprites.

## Important:
- The files in the `OptionalAssets` folder are optional and not required for the core functionality of the package.
- Use these files only if you need lower-resolution images.
- If you do not require these additional assets, you can ignore this folder.
